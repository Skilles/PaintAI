# PaintAI
A simple painting program which allows color and brush size adjustments.
As you are drawing the program will predict what digit is currently on the screen. 
Uses TensorFlowSharp and the MNIST database.
A Python script was used to train the model.

### TODO
+ Use Tensorflow 2.0 and Tensorflow .NET
+ Train and evaluate the model entirely in C#
+ Use the Google Quickdraw dataset to predict objects
